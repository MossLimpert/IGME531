    <p>I think using noise to determine rotation creates a weirder visual effect, where you can see just how much or how little it is altered, rather than the rotation angle just becoming more and more sever as the row number increases. It looks like hills or veins to me. <br><br>The shape that I've made isn't as readable as I'd like -- I designed it while looking at the large version and then didn't zoom out to see how it would look little. The right-most path's top arc is supposed to create visual tension with the top of the tile, but at this scale it looks like it is touching. Also in my creation of the svg with inkscape, The outer bounds of the square seems to be fixed at a size, that when scaled down, looks like weird artifacting.</p>
